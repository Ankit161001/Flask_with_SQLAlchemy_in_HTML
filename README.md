A practice repo containing multiple basic HTML webpages (with ```frames```) which are interconnected with the help of flask. The HTML pages are connected with a ```sqlite3``` database with the help of ```SQLAlchemy```.

```NOTE:``` The page ```registration.html``` takes in the inputs and adds them into the database.
<br>
```NOTE:``` The page ```login.html``` fetches the data from the database. If the data is valid, then it flashes success message.
